    <h1>&lt;Adress&gt;</h1>
    <p>Defines the contact information
        for the author, people, or organization
        relevant to an HTML page (usually
        appearing at the end of the page, if at all)
        or part of a page, such as within a report or
        a news article</p>
        <p>Most of the time, contact information
            takes the form of the author's email address
            or a link to a page with more contact information.
            The contact information could very well
            be the author's postal address, in which case
            marking it up with address would be valid.
            But if you're creating the Contact Us page for
            your business and want to include your office
            locations, it would be incorrect to code those
            with address.</p>
