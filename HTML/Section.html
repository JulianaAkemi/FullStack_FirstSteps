    <h1>&lt;section&gt;</h1>
    <p>A generic section of a document or
        application. A section, in this context,
        is a thematic grouping of content,
        typically with a heading</p>
    <p>Examples of sections would be chapters,
            the various tabbed pages in a
            tabbed dialog box, or the numbered
            sections of a thesis. A Web site's
            homepage could be split into sections
            for an introduction, news items,
            and contact information.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that section is not a
        generic container like div, because section
        conveys meaning and div has absolutely no
        semantic meaning</p>
    <p>Role = "main"</p>
    <p> Article = Is your content an independent piece of content or a widget that would be appropriate for syndication?</p>

            ➝ complicatedly named and curiously
            ➝ unfinished masterpiece that is
            ➝ the Expiatory Temple of the
            ➝ Sacred Family is the most visited
            ➝ building in Barcelona. In it, Gaudí
            ➝ combines his vision of nature and
            ➝ architecture with his devotion
            ➝ to his faith. The Sagrada Família
            ➝ attracts even the non-religious to
            ➝ its doors in large part due to its
            ➝ tragic story and its still
            ➝ unfinished state, of which the
            ➝ everpresent scaffolding and cranes
            ➝ are permanent reminders.</p>
