    <h1>&lt;Time&gt;</h1>
    <p>One of the most common uses of time is
        to indicate the publication date of an article
        element. To do so, include the pubdate
        attribute. The time element with pubdate
        represents the publication date of the
        nearest ancestor article element</p>
        <p>You
            could also time-stamp an article’s readersubmitted
            comments with time, datetime,
            and pubdate, assuming each comment
            is wrapped in an article element that is
            nested in the article to which the comment
            relates</p>
            <p>If you use time with pubdate to indicate
                an article’s publication date, it’s common
                but not mandatory to place it in either a
                header or footer element of the article
                element. Regardless, be sure it’s nested somewhere
                within the relevant article.</p>

                <article>
                    <header>
                    <h1>Cheetah and Gazelle Make Fast
                    ➝ Friends</h1>
                    <p><time datetime="2011-10-15"
                    ➝ pubdate="pubdate">October 15,
                    ➝ 2011</time></p>
                    </header>
                    ... [article content] ...
                    </article>

            <p>Don’t use time to mark up imprecise
                dates or times, such as "the mid-1900s," "just
                after midnight," "the latter part of the Renaissance,"
                or "early last week."</p>
                <p>The datetime attribute provides the date and time in a machinereadable
                    format, which I’ve simplified for this initial example:
                    YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss</p>

            <p>The train arrives at <time>08:45</time>
                ➝ and <time>16:20</time> on
                ➝ <time>2012-04-10</time>.</p>
                <p>We began our descent from the peak of
                ➝ Everest on <time datetime="1952-06-12T11:
                ➝ 05:00">June 12, 1952 at 11:05 a.m.
                ➝ </time></p>
                <p>They made their dinner reservation
                ➝ for <time datetime="2011-09-20T18:
                ➝ 30:00">tonight at 6:30</time>.</p>
                <p>The record release party is on <time
                ➝ datetime="2011-12-09"></time>.</p>

                <p>If you omit the datetime attribute, the
                    text content must conform to the valid date or
                    time format. In other words, the first example 
                    could not be coded as <p>The train
                    arrives at <time>8:45 a.m.</time> and
                    <time>4:20 p.m.</time> on <time>October
                    4th, 2012</time>.</p>. However, when you
                    do include datetime, you’re free to represent
                    the date or time in the text content as you
                    wish, as seen in the second and third examples</p>
